## ABSTRACT
This is a very famous 90's game which is played with a gun. The overall aim is to shot the flying duck with gun but wouldnt it be cool if you can shot directly with your hand gestures.
So, here is the project made for SHRISHTI 2018 in which i used Microseoft KINECT to play the game with hands.
