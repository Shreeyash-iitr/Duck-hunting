## ABSTRACT</br>
This is a very famous 90's game which is played with a gun. The overall aim is to shot the flying duck with gun but wouldnt it be cool if you can shot directly with your hand gestures!!</br>
So, here is the project made for SHRISHTI 2018 in which i used Microseoft KINECT to play the game with hands. 

## SETUP


Install Processing Software & Kinect SDK from internet. Connect kinect to your PC. Let it install the driver automatically. Write your code on Processing and Run It!!!
