## ABSTRACT</br>
This is a very famous 90's game which is played with a gun. The overall aim is to shot the flying duck with gun but wouldnt it be cool if you can shot directly with your hand gestures!!</br>
So, here is the project made for SHRISHTI 2018 in which i used Microseoft KINECT to play the game with hands. 

## SETUP


Install Processing Software & Kinect SDK from internet. Connect kinect to your PC. Let it install the driver automatically. Write your code on Processing and Run It!!!

## REQUIREMENTS
1. Xbox Kinect (Microsoft Product)</br><img src='images/kinect.jpg' width = 200>
2. Laptop with high graphic quality(at least 4GB graphic card)</br>
3. Processing software(Open source software)</br><img src='images/processing.png' width = 200>

## LIBRARIES USED
   Processing has inbuilt libraries for kinect, just download it from internet. Required libraries are:-
    
   . Kinect V2 for Processing - Kinect v2 implementation using the Kinect Windows SDK 
   
   . Kinect4WinSDK - A simple wrapper for the Microsoft Kinect for Windows SDK version 1.8
   
   . Sound - Sound library based on MethCla for Processing
   
   These libraries have inbuilt code examples for detecting body, body depth, body joint coordinates, colour image.
